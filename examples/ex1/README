This example contains Java sources for four example directories:
	ex1boot-bean
	ex1boot=prv
	ex1run-bean
	ex1run-prv
	
boot - in the name of the example directory indicates that 
service providers and requestors are bootstrapped with their own code servers.

run - in the name of the example directory indicates that both
service providers and requestors require to have a code server (webster) 
already running.

To start the SORCER environment for these examples run the Ant script
${IGRID_HOME}/bin/iGrid-min-boot.xml

To start a webster for your providers and requestors run the Ant script
${IGRID_HOME}/bin/webster/bin/webster-run.xml

To start a service browser run the Ant script
${IGRID_HOME}/bin/browser/bin/service-browser-run.xml

To run an Ant script:
	a) in Eclipse IDE select an Ant script, then from a popup menu select "Run As/Ant Build"
	b) on a command line call "ant -f <script filename>"
