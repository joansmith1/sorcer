Examples for service components (beans) running with 
a required code server (webster) - webster-beans (WB).
A webster is required for both a service provider and requestor.
The functionality of providers and requestors is similar 
as in the example ex1boot-bean.

For prerequisites and how to run Ant scripts see the README file in the ex1 directory.

Start a webster by running the Ant script
${IGRID_HOME}/bin/webster/bin/webster-run.xml 
before you run Ant provider scripts:
whoIsItBean1-prv-run.xml and whoIsItBean2-prv-run.xml
then requestor scripts:
whoIsItBean1-req-run.xml and whoIsItBean2-req-run.xml
