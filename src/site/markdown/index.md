#### SORCER Architecture

![SORCER Architecture](carousel/carousel-SOS_EaaaS.png)

SORCER Operating System is a true service-oriented programming environment that
realizes the concept of Everything Anytime Anywhere (AWAT) as a Service (EaaaS).


#### Transdisciplinary Service-Oriented Computing

![Transdisciplinary SO Computing](carousel/carousel-SOS_trans.png)

SORCER programming model and scalability allows users to pass the limits of engineering disciplines enabling
a true transdisciplinary approach.


#### SORCER Service Browser

![SORCER Service Browser](carousel/carousel-browser.png)

SORCER uses intelligent zero-configuration discovery-join protocols that find all services available in the user's
network. The SORCER Service Browser enables users to access these services no matter where they are deployed.

#### Custom Service User Interface

Services may expose a graphical user interface that may be immediately accessed using the SORCER Service Browser
without any installation or configuration.

## SORCER
The Service ORiented Computing EnviRonment (SORCER) is a distributed computing platform implemented in Java.
It allows writing network-programs (called "exertions") that operate on wrapped applications (services) spread across the network.
SORCER is often utilized in similar scenarios to those where grids are used (Grid computing) to run parallel tasks.

SORCER introduces a novel service-oriented programming model that uses federations of services dynamically found in the whole network
 to execute network-programs (exertions).
Dynamically federated services integrate various science and engineering domains fostering transdisciplinary modeling and programming. 
A friendly and intuitive service-oriented programming model allows the users to dynamically compose the relevant service federations.
These federations range from tens to thousands or even millions of services and execute in the global network with an unprecedented level of reliability.
